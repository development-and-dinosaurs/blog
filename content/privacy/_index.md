## The data we collect about you
Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

All data is collected through automated technology and third parties. As you interact with the site, certain data will be made available as part of that process- such as browser type, referring site, and other pieces of data.

## How we use this data
All data is used for analytical purposes only, to ensure that there aren't any areas of the site that are broken or underperforming, and to get an idea of the areas of the site or particular posts that are of particular interest to certain groups of people.
