Laserlife is a rhythm game set in space, where you play as an alien intelligence that is manifesting the memories of a dead astronaut by collecting memory molecules. To a funky beat, so it's less macabre. 

I enjoyed the unique controls. I used a controller rather than the "Intel® RealSense™ Camera" because they're expensive and I don't have one, but the controller was quite good anyway. You control two lasers with the analog sticks which you direct around the screen to hit the correct notes, sometimes using the triggers to collect the notes, sometimes not. 

Unfortunately for a rhythm game the music wasn't all that varied or particularly great. It was _fine_, but I'd prefer a rhythm game to have songs that I'd listen to outside of the game, whereas Laserlife does not. It was good in that it fit the theme, and it's a short game so there's not going to be a massive amount of songs there. However despite that, there's still a lot of repetition which made replaying levels across difficulties a bit bland. 

The achievements were good in that most are for "do the stuff in the game", mainly unlocking the memories by completing the levels. The hardest one was collecting every memory molecule, but you can do that on easy mode which is a lot simpler, but also more dull.

Overall I enjoyed the time I played Laserlife, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone unless you already think you'd enjoy it too.
