Owl. My. Godwit. I love Hatoful Boyfriend so much. What looks like an absolutely ridiculous pigeon dating simulator visual novel turns into a feather-raising build up to a flap-tivating crescendo of a storyline. Things are not what they seem at St. PigeoNation's Institute, and it's a flap-tastic time unravelling what is really going on. 

Don't get me wrong, at it's core this really is just an absolutely ridiculous pigeon dating simulator, so if that doesn't sound appealing then first of all, what is wrong with you? But also if you're not into that then you won't be into this. But there's a good deal of humour here- a wide cast of different tweethearts, with unique personalities and real growth. 

The gameplay is standard visual novel fare- progress the story up until you need to make a choice, make the choice, _feather the consequences_, rinse and repeat for each choice. There are multiple routes resulting in multiple endings where you learn more about the underlying storyline until you unlock the final route where the game really takes flight, which is the part I enjoyed the most. 

Depending on how fast you read, you've got around 15-20 hours of game here to go through every route once, although that includes flying through the common scenes most of the time. Achievements are tied to endings so it's very much "See everything the game has to offer" which is great. 

In conclusion, Hatoful Boyfriend is a feathery delight that defies expectations with its bird-brained brilliance. It's a game that may start as a lighthearted pigeon dating simulator but evolves into a compelling narrative with wings of intrigue. Whether you're a fan of visual novels or just looking for a beak-utifully quirky gaming experience, Hatoful Boyfriend is sure to leave you tweeting.
