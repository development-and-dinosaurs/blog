I really like to read, so visual novels as a game genre are right up my alley. Doki Doki Literature Club isn't the first visual novel I've played (and won't be the last), but it's the first one I picked up on Steam. This is in part because it's free, partly because I've been exposed to a bunch of content through the DDLC subreddit, and then the astronomical number of overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam sealed the deal. 

So unsurprisingly I really enjoyed it. Both "sides" of the story were entertaining, I enjoyed the way everything unfolded and I played through it several times to unlock every ending. The "gameplay" of picking words to align to the interests of each of the girls isn't super engaging, but as a thematic vehicle to drive the story forward in a way that isn't just "click next", it's fine.
