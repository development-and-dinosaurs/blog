It's a good job I like to read as it's another visual novel next, this time the first title in the Danganronpa series. I'd never heard of Danganronpa before until I played the Doomsday Getaway event in Dragalia Lost, which sports a plot and presentation that is very clearly inspired by Danganronpa. Check it out:

Anyway I quite enjoyed the intrigue of this event, so when so many people were comparing it to Danganronpa I thought that was worth a look too. 

It was so good. It _is_ so good. I liked it so much I bought it again on Steam along with 2 and 3 because I knew I was going to be playing every single thing I could that was Danganronpa related. 

I did 100% achievements which was maybe not as cool? Collecting every single present wasn't the best experience really, and school mode was fun at the start but definitely dragged on. I much prefer achievements where it's "experience all the game has to offer" rather than "do this mind-numbing thing again and again". But hey, I did do it anyway. 

The core gameplay loop is great though- strong story (if you're into that kind of thing), and gameplay comprising of an investigation where you collect evidence followed by trial where you can present it. The presentation of a gun loaded with bullets that can shoot down parts of testimony is really cool and helps to keep the game moving without having decision paralysis from so many options for what the next step is. 

Would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes "weird Japanese visual novels", but they've probably played it already.
