I lost steam. So here I am doing the same old thing again, but maybe this time it will be different.

Alright so I thought an idle game would be an easy one to start with, but I'm starting to think actually maybe gamedev in general is quite hard? I didn't manage to complete the core gameplay loop once I got around to the prestige mechanic, and it all spiralled out of control from there.

But that's not what I'm here to write, ten months after the fact. I did a nice little Godot 4 course through [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) and it was pretty good! This is to make a... jumping game? I don't know what the genre is, but I like it. I didn't follow along 100% so my implementation isn't ideal, but that's where I do what I do best and start again, hoping this time will be different (it won't).

To give myself the best chance, I'm splitting the featues I want into priority iterations, just like momma told us to back in the good ol' days. So I'm writing this now to keep myself honest - I'm going to release iteration 1 before I do any more work. All it will have is a title screen, a single level, and an end screen. That's a game. It's not a _good_ game, but it _is_ a game nonetheless.
