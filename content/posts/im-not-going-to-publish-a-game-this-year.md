So it turned out I did kind of lie when I said I was going to publish a game this year. In that I haven't, I won't, and maybe I shouldn't?

It's been very nearly a year since setting myself this goal, and whilst I've made fairly decent strides (if I do say so myself), it turns out that publishing a game is just really hard or something. However I have learned a lot of different things and should probably document some of that stuff too so I remember what I did without having to go digging. So that's what I'm going to do next to feel like I've accomplished something. 

However! I'm not entirely without success here. I probably _could_ publish _something_, it just wouldn't be very good and there's probably no point in putting something out there that I'm not proud of just to tick off an arbitrary goal. I might learn something from the process, but I already did put a lot of the legwork in so maybe that counts already. 

However, feast your eyes on a year of work (actually maybe a couple of months really since I scrapped my original idea 10 months in). 

I maybe kinda finished the title screen mostly? There's a title screen, and it's kind of interesting and lets you do the stuff you need to do from a title screen. I even spent way too long implementing a little easter egg if you stay on the title screen too long and let the meteor impact the earth. I think it's funny, but it did take too long to implement, and I made a mess doing it that I need to clean up. But it does look cool!

I made a little splash / loading screen too which was fun to implement and is reasonably extensible too. A good option for some blogumentation.

But it's not just fluff and stuff that isn't important, I've done some actual gameplay too! I've just put in a little test level for the first forest (jungle?) level and implemented a lot of the main mechanics for jumping, enemies, platforms, backgrounds, etc. which has been pretty neat.

Then I was planning on publishing this as the first little demo level on [itch.io](https://itch.io) but decided against it, but not before putting a bunch of work in to get it ready! 

Like the description:

And I even made a cover image for the main page and this cute little widget. Neat right?

Anyway the plan is - clean up some of the stuff I've done, blogument some of the neat things I might want to do again, and continue to work on this same game next year. I'll probably even do periodic devlogs too so I can remember what I've done and when. And then eventually maybe be in a position to actually publish? We'll see.
