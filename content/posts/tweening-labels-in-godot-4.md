Tweening labels is a fantastic way to add flair to your gameâ€™s UI, and adopting a component-based architecture makes it a breeze to reuse these effects across multiple areas of your project without duplicating code.

While working on [Jurassic Jump](/tags/jurassic-jump), I wanted to spice up my labels with animations. Godotâ€™s tweening system is incredibly versatile, and so far, Iâ€™ve implemented two effects: **scrambling and revealing text** and **enlarging text**. Letâ€™s dive into how these work and why theyâ€™re so effective.

## Scrambling and Revealing Text 

This is a really cool effect I use in the splash screens. Here's how it looks in action:

Whatâ€™s cool is that this effect can double as a text reveal, perfect for secrets, passwords, or suspenseful dialogue reveals:

The best part? The code is clean and reusable when extracted into its own TweenLabel scene.

```gdscript
## A control for displaying text using various tween effects
class_name TweenLabel extends Label


## Tween text over a period of time, which results in a scramble effect for the
## characters that have changed. Does not scramble characters that are the same
## between calls.
func tween_text(text: String, scramble_time: float, show_time: float) -> Tween:
	var tween = create_tween()
	tween.tween_property(self, "text", text, scramble_time)
	tween.tween_interval(show_time)
	return tween
```

With just a few lines of code, you can create effects that add polish and personality to your gameâ€™s UI.

## Enlarging Text 

For countdowns or dramatic emphasis, enlarging labels over time is a great trick. Hereâ€™s how it looks in Jurassic Jumpâ€™s countdown timer:

This effect uses a `tween_font_size function`. While I ran into some hiccups with theme compatibility, the results are worth the effort:

```gdscript
## Tween font size over a period of time, which causes a label to grow or shrink
## in size over time. 
func tween_font_size(font_size: int, duration: float) -> Tween:
	var tween := create_tween()
	tween.tween_property(self, "label_settings:font_size", 200, duration)
	return tween
```

The implementation could benefit from further refinementâ€”like creating a dedicated `CountdownLabel` to simplify timing and orchestration â€” but for now, it works well enough.

## Wrapping Up

Godotâ€™s tweening system opens up endless possibilities for animating labels and other UI elements. Whether itâ€™s scrambling text for a splash screen or enlarging it for dramatic effect, these techniques can help elevate your gameâ€™s polish.

I hope this post sparks ideas for your projects (or serves as a handy reference when I inevitably forget how I did this).

Happy tweening! ðŸš€
