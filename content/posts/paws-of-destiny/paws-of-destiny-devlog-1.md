Paws of Destiny is what you get when you mix an ambitious child that loves dogs with a weak-willed father who can't stay on task for more than two days. 

I did think that I would be able to work on Jurassic Idlevolution for a little bit longer before "having" to pivot to something else, but the writing was on the wall as soon as the kids started talking about their ideas for game development. 

Maybe I'm being a loving and supporting father, helping my children to grow their skills and expertise and chase their dreams. Or maybe I am just procrastinating developing my own work. Actually, maybe it's both! 

Whatever the reason, we're now working on Paws of Destiny, which I hope is a working title but will probably end up being the final product too. 

> "Paws of Destiny" invites players to em*bark* on an epic canine adventure with Barkley, a spirited dog on a mission to collect bones and thwart the nefarious plans of the evil cat king, Sidney. Navigate through charming landscapes, overcome treacherous obstacles, and engage in lively battles against feline foes. As Barkley's loyal companion, players must master the art of bone collecting and use their *pawsome* skills to outwit cunning enemies. Will Barkley emerge victorious in this tail-wagging journey of destiny? The fate of the doggy kingdom rests in your paws!

Sounds impressive right? The kids wanted 3D platformers but I'm not about that life, so we're going 2D as that should be a lot easier. I'm kind of impressed by how easy it was to get up and running with a working "prototype" which will probably end up as the finished game too.

I got to use some cool stuff I've never done in Godot before, like Raycast2D which was surprisingly easy to get working. This is what lets the cat turn around when it gets to the edge of the platform. Tilemaps were also really neat, and the collisions were a breeze to add on top. Once we've got some collectibles, the ability to attack and be attacked, and a goal for each level, we'll be ready to go. 

I am kind of hoping there won't be too many more of these updates, but I'm sure this won't be the last.
