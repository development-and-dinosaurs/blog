The Rex Remix Games website has launched! You know it's getting serious now because websites cost money, so I've got a vested interest in completing things now.

## What's there

Not a lot! The website is mainly a landing page to direct people to as a call to action before there's a Steam page (which also costs money, just more).

The website is at [https://rexremix.games](https://rexremix.games) and there's... stuff there. Like a devlog. Suspiciously similar to the one here.

There's a mailing list set up too for the Rex Remix Games newsletter which you can sign up for at [https://newsletter.rexremix.games](https://newsletter.rexremix.games). This won't do a lot to begin with but will include development information as things are built, and announce major milestones like Steam page creation, demo launch, game launch, etc.

Alright that's enough distractions for now â€” back to the game ðŸŽ®
