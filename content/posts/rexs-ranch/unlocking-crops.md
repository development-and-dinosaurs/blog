Not all crops are unlocked at the start of Rex's Ranch, and now there's a system that will let you unlock them.

There are a lot of different ways to unlock crops in Rex's Ranch - some are unlocked just by shipping a certain number of other crops, others must be discovered via other activities such as fishing and debris clearing, whilst yet others are unlocked through your relationships with the villagers in the world. 

In theory anyway, right now we don't have fishing, debris clearing, or other villagers. So shipping crops is all you get. But the system is in place and it works nicely, as you can see below.

This is all hooked up to the save system too, so if you unlock a crop it stays unlocked.

Until next time!
