I am on a metaphorical roll here, doing stuff every day. Jurassic Idlevolution has inched closer to completion, though not by a huge amount. But slow and steady might win this race.

I've added some more stuff, but none of it is gameplay yet. I mean, not meaningful gameplay anyway. But having a cute bouncing dinosaur that you can click on to fake-generate DNA is... kind of a game? I guess? I mean, what *is* a *game* really? I feel like I should probably know that before embarking on this adventure, but maybe that's more a philosophical question. For the purpose of this project and meeting this resolution, anything can be a game as long as it gets published somewhere.

Look at that little cutie! Obviously everything is still a little rough around the edges, but I feel like there's only a little bit more to go to actually have something that resembles a game. Probably more than I think, but it's getting there!
