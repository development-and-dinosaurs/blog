I haven't had much time to work on the game recently but this game is definitely more game now, for real.

So this change is adding the DNA label to the header, and incrementing the amount of DNA available (and displayed in the label) when clicking on the compsognathus in the habitat. You can't do anything with it yet, but DNA will be the main currency in the game for doing stuff.

I think I've skipped a step here in the game progression, where did we get this compsognathus from? We'd need to buy the compy from the habitat first, which means spending DNA. But then we'd need to get the DNA from somewhere - so that's the part that's missing. Cookie Clicker has a giant cookie, we have the concept of tapping on an egg. Maybe I just need to put the egg in the game.
